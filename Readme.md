# BBIT CAMPUS PROJECT 
## My final year Project for my DIPLOMA
# INTRODUCTION
India is the fastest growing telecom Network in the world with many users moving towards
Smart phones and majority by Students. Now, Mobile Phones have become an organ of our body
i.e. Many users are using many applications in today's life such as games apps, video calling
apps, photographs apps, shopping apps etc. So I want to introduce an Android Application
especially for BBIT Students.BBC enable the user especially students to find and access all
information related to him/her.In BBC student can download study materials like eBooks ,exam
papers ,etc. Also Students can get to know about their results, the rank in their college etc. BBC
helps Students to get study related information at one place.
# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
Android being a relatively new technology, the future scope in the project is boundless.
Scalability would be the biggest scope. The application can be made available off campus as
well whereby only certain services would be made available to the user. Information security
plays a vital role in the system work model for ensuring confidentiality and integrity, smooth
functioning and reduced misuse of the system. Advanced security features can be employed for
enhanced functioning of the application.
As of for now, the project will enable the college student to download the study material such
as question bank, assignment questions, tutorials etc. But in the near future, if the lecturer or the
professor is not able to take lectures for a long duration, then the lecturer can make a video of
the lecture from his workplace and give it to the administrator to upload it on the server, and the
corresponding link will be send to the students.

Thus the process of e-learning can be incorporated with the BBIT project in the future to
provide a robust learning system with the BBIT being a communication system or bridging the
gap for a better learning experience. Being a relatively new idea in India, we can even go
commercial with the idea and provide numerous campuses with the application.
# OBJECTIVE
Ubiquity across an enterprise or campus is a very positive and exciting experience for the
students, faculty, staff and visitors to the institution. Having instant access to email, the internet,
and other IT services irrespective of location can dramatically change the way your constituents
live, work, study, learn, and play. Thus with BBIT we provide a ubiquitous environment across
the campus wherein it will serve as a collaborative communicative system. Our concept of
developing a campus information system seeks to answer these questions in a personalized way,
at any time, at any location. The idea is to enable the user to find and access all information that
is of relevance to him. All he needs is a smart phone which enables the execution of an android
application. All used techniques are in themselves not new or unique, but the combination of
instant messaging. On top of that, the system based on a platform made purely for research is in
the stage of evolving into a product and is even now being utilized as a public service oncampus.
There is also an approach to use mobile devices for interaction during classroom
teaching. Altogether we find a situation on Campus, where students use their mobile device for
learning and interacting.
